# Project Overview

## Objective:
The objective of this project was to analyze a Toy Sales dataset and derive meaningful insights from it. The dataset contains information about sales transactions, including details such as product information, order dates, sales amounts, and customer details.

## Tools Used:
- Database: MySQL
- Analysis Environment: SQL

## Key Steps in Analysis:

### Data Retrieval and Exploration
1. Retrieved all columns for all records in the dataset.
2. Identified unique product lines, statuses, and deal sizes in the dataset.

### Product Analysis
3. Explored the relationship between product codes and their corresponding product lines.
4. Analyzed the number of shipped products across different product lines.
5. Examined product details based on their status (e.g., shipped, canceled).

### Data Cleaning
6. Changed the data type of the order date column from string to date and updated the format.

### Sales Analysis
7. Calculated total sales amounts across product lines, months, and years.
8. Identified the top 5 cities and top 3 countries with the highest sales.
9. Determined the top 10 customers and top 10 product codes based on sales.

### Additional Insights
10. Calculated the average price of each product line.
11. Explored the deal size of customers.
12. Investigated the number of canceled orders and their associated sales values.
13. Examined details of canceled and orders in process.
14. Identified the top 5 customers with the highest order quantities.

# Key Findings:

- **Product Analysis:** The analysis revealed insights into the distribution of products across different lines and their shipment status.
- **Sales Insights:** The total sales amounts across various dimensions (product line, month, year) were analyzed, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance.
- **Customer and Location Analysis:** Top customers, cities, and countries with the highest sales were identified.
- **Cancellation Analysis:** Explored details of canceled orders and the associated sales values.
- **Quantity Analysis:** Identified the top 5 customers with the highest order quantities.

# Conclusions:

- The dataset provides valuable information about product distribution, sales patterns, and customer behavior.
- Insights gained can be used to optimize inventory management, sales strategies, and customer engagement.
- The analysis demonstrates the power of SQL for extracting meaningful insights from structured datasets.



This project analysis provides a foundation for informed decision-making and future explorations in the domain of toy sales.
